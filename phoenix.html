    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Phoenix began life as the Polaris orbital hotel.  After the Polaris accident, Helios purchased the ruined station in 1992 and repurposed it as the backbone of a spinning Mars ship.  The craft was constructed between 1992 and 1994, incorporating Helios’ in‑house Osprey‑methane engines and a centrifugal gravity ring.  Dev Ayesa originally planned to automate the ship, but Ed Baldwin insisted on a manual configuration.</p>

    <h2>Mission & Crew</h2>
    <p>Phoenix launched in 1994 as Helios’ crewed vehicle to Martian orbit.  The ship’s spacious habitation ring — a remnant of its hotel heritage — allowed the crew to travel comfortably and supported research modules and a hydroponic garden.  Attached to the front of the ring were multiple landing pods carrying HAB rovers, drills and fuel production equipment for the Mars base.  A dedicated Mars Surface Access Module (MSAM) nicknamed “Popeye” ferried personnel and cargo between Phoenix and the Martian surface.</p>

    <h2>Transformation into a Station</h2>
    <p>After the 1994 mission, Phoenix remained in Mars orbit.  In the late 1990s the ship transitioned into a permanent space and transit station.  By the early 2000s Phoenix served as a hub for Helios’ Unity transport vehicle, facilitating crew and cargo transfers for the Mars‑7 Alliance.</p>
