    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>Before it became the pride of Helios, <em>Phoenix</em> began life as the Polaris orbital hotel.  Following the Polaris accident, Helios acquired the damaged station in 1992 and reimagined it as a spinning, deep‑space vessel unlike anything before it.  Our engineers rebuilt the structure between 1992 and 1994, outfitting it with proprietary Osprey‑methane engines, a centrifugal gravity ring and a resilient pressure hull.  Dev Ayesa first envisioned a fully automated design, but veteran astronaut Ed Baldwin advocated for a human‑centric configuration — and Helios delivered a craft that combined cutting‑edge automation with the intuition of a trained crew.</p>

    <h2>Mission & Crew</h2>
    <p>Phoenix launched in 1994 as the first privately funded interplanetary vessel, carrying Helios’s crew to Martian orbit.  Its spacious habitation ring — derived from its hotel heritage — provided artificial gravity and comfort rarely seen in space travel.  Research modules and a lush hydroponic garden allowed the crew to conduct science and grow fresh food en route.  Mounted ahead of the ring were landing pods laden with HAB rovers, drills and equipment for in‑situ fuel production, demonstrating Helios’s holistic approach to mission design.  A dedicated Mars Surface Access Module (MSAM) nicknamed “Popeye” shuttled personnel and cargo between Phoenix and the surface with reliability and ease.</p>

    <h2>Transformation into a Station</h2>
    <p>After its maiden voyage, Phoenix remained in Mars orbit and evolved into a permanent space station.  Through the late 1990s, Helios engineers upgraded the vessel’s systems and added docking ports, cargo handling facilities and life‑support enhancements.  By the early 2000s Phoenix served as the hub of our Unity transport vehicle, facilitating crew and cargo transfers for the Mars‑7 Alliance.  Its continued service as a transit station underscores Helios’s commitment to building long‑term infrastructure that supports human life beyond Earth.</p>
