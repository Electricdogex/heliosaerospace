    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Happy Valley began as NASA’s pioneering foothold on Mars in early 1995, constructed in Melas Chasma within the majestic Valles Marineris canyon system.  From the outset Helios supplied expertise, equipment and vision, helping deliver modules, rovers and supplies through a 1993 support mission.  Though the initial habitat was designed for six astronauts, the spirit of cooperation allowed the base to welcome additional explorers without compromising safety or comfort.</p>
    <p>When a natural landslide destroyed the nearby Helios base, our crew joined forces with NASA and Roscosmos in Happy Valley.  This unity sparked the creation of the Mars‑7 Alliance, which transformed the outpost into an international colony with over 100 residents by 1997.  Helios’s contributions—from robust power systems to habitat expansions—were instrumental in the colony’s growth.  By 2006 Happy Valley stands as the beating heart of Martian civilization and a shining example of what collaborative exploration can achieve.</p>

    <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>Today Happy Valley is a thriving complex of connected cylindrical modules radiating from a central hub.  One module hosts verdant hydroponic gardens that supply fresh food year‑round; others contain state‑of‑the‑art laboratories, comfortable crew quarters and spacious storage areas.  Solar arrays and a compact fusion reactor provide abundant power.  A fleet of rovers and crawlers—delivered by NASA and enhanced by Helios—supports construction, exploration and mining.  The arrival of Helios’s HAB rover and advanced drilling equipment extended the pressurized complex, underscoring our commitment to building sustainable infrastructure on Mars.</p>

    <h2>Crew (1995‑2005)</h2>
    <p>Happy Valley’s population evolved from its early NASA–Soviet crew into a vibrant community representing partners from around the world.  After consolidating at the base, astronauts from Helios, NASA and Roscosmos lived and worked side by side, joined later by other international explorers.  Helios team members such as Ed Baldwin, Louisa Mueller and Lars Hagstrom played pivotal roles in developing life‑support systems, expanding the habitat and fostering a culture of collaboration.  The colony also welcomed a rescued North Korean cosmonaut, reflecting our belief that Mars belongs to all humanity.</p>
