    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Happy Valley was NASA’s first base on Mars, assembled in early 1995 within the canyon Melas Chasma of the Valles Marineris system.  Modules, rovers and supplies were delivered by a support mission launched in 1993.  The base was originally designed for six astronauts, but the rescue of the Soviet Mars‑94 crew forced Sojourner 1 to land with eight people, straining resources.</p>
    <p>After the Gagarin Ridge drilling disaster destroyed Helios’ Mars base, surviving crew members from Helios, NASA and Roscosmos consolidated in Happy Valley.  In 1997 the Mars‑7 Alliance transformed the outpost into an international colony with more than 100 inhabitants.  By 2006 Happy Valley remains the heart of human activity on Mars.</p>

    <h2>Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>The colony consists of three cylindrical modules connected to a central hub.  One module houses hydroponic gardens while others contain laboratories, crew quarters and storage.  Solar panels and a nuclear generator supply power.  Pre‑supply containers delivered three rovers—two four‑wheel vehicles and a crawler—to support construction and exploration.  When the Helios HAB rover joined the base, it expanded the pressurized complex.</p>

    <h2>Crew (1995‑2005)</h2>
    <p>Happy Valley’s population has evolved over time.  Initially eight astronauts (four Americans and four Soviets) inhabited the base.  Following the consolidation of crews, the roster included representatives from NASA, Helios and Roscosmos, as well as a rescued North Korean cosmonaut.  Key Helios personnel at the colony included Ed Baldwin, Louisa Mueller and Lars Hagstrom.</p>
