    <h2>About Helios</h2>
    <p>Helios Aerospace is a visionary, multi‑national aerospace company founded in 1987 by Dev Ayesa and Richard Hilliard in Houston, Texas.  Building on a breakthrough in nuclear fusion, Helios won a NASA contract to mine Helium‑3 on the Moon in 1987 and has since expanded into space manufacturing and energy production.  In 1992 Helios purchased the Polaris orbital hotel and repurposed it into the <em>Phoenix</em> spacecraft, announcing a bold crewed mission to Mars for 1994. </p>
    <p>By 2006, Helios has established itself as a cornerstone of Mars exploration: it landed its own crew on Mars in the mid‑1990s, constructed a base on the red planet, and later converted the Phoenix into a space station.  Helios now provides critical infrastructure for the Mars‑7 Alliance and the Happy Valley colony.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Helios was founded to push humanity beyond low Earth orbit and into the solar system.  From commercial lunar mining to building the <em>Phoenix</em> — the first privately‑funded interplanetary spacecraft — our ethos is one of innovation, courage and cooperation.  We believe a thriving human presence on Mars is not a fantasy but an achievable goal.  The events of the last decade have proved that nations and private companies can work together to overcome obstacles and build a home on another world.  Our continuing mission is to develop technology, infrastructure and opportunities that allow anyone to journey to the red planet.</p>
