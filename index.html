    <h2>About Helios</h2>
    <p>Helios Aerospace stands at the vanguard of humanity’s ascent to the stars.  Founded in 1987 by visionary Dev Ayesa and innovator Richard Hilliard, the company harnessed revolutionary nuclear fusion technology to win NASA’s Helium‑3 mining contract, bringing clean energy to the world.  From there, Helios delivered breakthrough after breakthrough, transforming the Polaris orbital hotel into the trailblazing <em>Phoenix</em> spacecraft and announcing a bold, privately funded mission to Mars.</p>
    <p>By 2006 Helios isn’t just a participant in space exploration — it is the cornerstone.  Helios crews walked on Mars, built the first private base on the red planet and later converted <em>Phoenix</em> into a permanent space station.  Through our leadership the Mars‑7 Alliance and Happy Valley colony thrive, proving that the future belongs to those who dare.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>Our mission is nothing less than the permanent expansion of humanity’s horizons.  Helios champions the spirit of innovation, courage and collaboration that transforms impossibilities into realities.  The <em>Phoenix</em> stands as proof: the first privately funded interplanetary spacecraft, forged from the ashes of an orbital hotel.  We know a thriving human civilization on Mars is not merely a dream but an inevitability when we lead the way.  In partnership with governments and other visionaries, Helios continues to build the technology and infrastructure that will open Mars to everyone, turning the red planet into our second home.</p>
