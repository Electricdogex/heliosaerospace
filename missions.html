    <h2>Race to Mars</h2>
    <p>In 1992 Helios announced that <em>Phoenix</em> would be ready to launch in 1994, two years ahead of NASA and Roscosmos.  Dev Ayesa recruited former NASA astronaut Ed Baldwin to command the mission.  Phoenix launched in October 1994 alongside Sojourner 1 and Mars‑94.  Although Phoenix initially trailed its competitors, a solar sail on Sojourner catapulted NASA into the lead and a risky engine burn put the Soviet craft ahead.</p>
    <p>When Mars‑94 suffered an engine failure, Phoenix was theoretically the perfect craft for a rescue, but Helios mission control opted to press onward.  Ed Baldwin attempted to mount an unauthorized rescue, but a software update from Earth prevented the crew from lighting their engines.  Phoenix arrived at Mars after Sojourner, missing the chance to be first on the surface.  A dust storm forced the crew to abort their initial landing attempt, allowing Sojourner 1 to touch down first.</p>

    <h2>Crew</h2>
    <p>The Phoenix carried a diverse crew of 16.  Key members included mission commander Ed Baldwin, pilot Danny Stevens, Nick Corrado, Louisa Mueller, Adarsh Sethi and Dr. Benjamin Harmon.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>Though Phoenix eventually landed and established a base, the mission failed to be first on Mars and was marred by tragedy.  A drilling accident at Gagarin Ridge triggered a landslide that destroyed Helios’ base and killed several crew members.  Survivors relocated to NASA’s Happy Valley base and Phoenix remained in orbit as the only vehicle capable of returning the combined crews to Earth.</p>
