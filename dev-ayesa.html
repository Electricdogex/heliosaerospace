    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Dev Ayesa is a trailblazing entrepreneur and engineer who co‑founded Helios Aerospace to transform humanity’s destiny.  Under his leadership, Helios won NASA’s Helium‑3 mining contract in 1987, bringing clean fusion energy to the world.  After the Polaris hotel incident, Dev turned adversity into opportunity, purchasing the damaged station and transforming it into <em>Phoenix</em>, the most advanced interplanetary spacecraft ever conceived.  By recruiting legendary astronaut Ed Baldwin and announcing a 1994 launch, Dev ensured Helios would lead the race to Mars.</p>
    <p>A fearless visionary, Dev’s leadership breaks conventions to achieve the extraordinary.  Even when others doubted or hesitated, he remained resolute, guiding <em>Phoenix</em> onward.  To preserve Helios’s culture of innovation, he reclaimed the company in 2003 from complacent board members and reasserted a bold, adventurous direction.</p>
    <p>Dev remains devoted to building a multi‑planetary civilization.  He envisions Mars as a society unbound by old divisions and open to anyone who shares the dream.  Under his guidance, Helios continues to invest heavily in robotics, propulsion and life‑support technologies that make Mars accessible for everyone.</p>
