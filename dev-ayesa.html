    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Dev Ayesa is an entrepreneur and engineer who co‑founded Helios Aerospace with Richard Hilliard.  In April 1987 Helios won a NASA contract to mine Helium‑3 on the Moon, a breakthrough that provided clean fusion energy to the world.  After the near‑disaster aboard the Polaris orbital hotel, Dev purchased the damaged station and transformed it into the Phoenix spacecraft.  He recruited former NASA astronaut Ed Baldwin to command Helios’ Mars mission and announced that Helios would launch in 1994, beating NASA and Roscosmos.</p>
    <p>Dev’s unorthodox leadership style and willingness to take risks defined Helios.  When the Mars mission faltered due to a rescue controversy, he maintained course, pushing Phoenix onward.  Following the Gagarin Ridge disaster and subsequent setbacks, Dev temporarily stepped down from Helios.  In 2003 he partnered with Kelly Baldwin and Aleida Rosales to stage a hostile takeover and reclaim the company, immediately firing board members opposed to his vision.</p>
    <p>Dev remains committed to building a sustainable human presence on Mars.  He views the colony not as a national project but as a new society open to all, and he continues to invest in robotics and propulsion technologies to make Mars accessible.</p>
